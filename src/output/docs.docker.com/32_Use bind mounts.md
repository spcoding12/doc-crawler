In [part 4](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/workshop/05_persisting_data/), you used a volume mount to persist the data in your database. A volume mount is a great choice when you need somewhere persistent to store your application data.

A bind mount is another type of mount, which lets you share a directory from the host's filesystem into the container. When working on an application, you can use a bind mount to mount source code into the container. The container sees the changes you make to the code immediately, as soon as you save a file. This means that you can run processes in the container that watch for filesystem changes and respond to them.

In this chapter, you'll see how you can use bind mounts and a tool called [nodemon](https://npmjs.com/package/nodemon) to watch for file changes, and then restart the application automatically. There are equivalent tools in most other languages and frameworks.

## [Quick volume type comparisons](#quick-volume-type-comparisons)

The following are examples of a named volume and a bind mount using `--mount`:

  * Named volume: `type=volume,src=my-volume,target=/usr/local/data`
  * Bind mount: `type=bind,src=/path/to/data,target=/usr/local/data`

The following table outlines the main differences between volume mounts and bind mounts.

| Named volumes| Bind mounts  
---|---|---  
Host location| Docker chooses| You decide  
Populates new volume with container contents| Yes| No  
Supports Volume Drivers| Yes| No  
  
## [Trying out bind mounts](#trying-out-bind-mounts)

Before looking at how you can use bind mounts for developing your application, you can run a quick experiment to get a practical understanding of how bind mounts work.

  1. Verify that your `getting-started-app` directory is in a directory defined in Docker Desktop's file sharing setting. This setting defines which parts of your filesystem you can share with containers. For details about accessing the setting, see [File sharing](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings-and-maintenance/settings/#file-sharing).

> Note
> 
> The **File sharing** tab is only available in Hyper-V mode, because the files are automatically shared in WSL 2 mode and Windows container mode.

  2. Open a terminal and change directory to the `getting-started-app` directory.

  3. Run the following command to start `bash` in an `ubuntu` container with a bind mount.

Mac / Linux  Command Prompt  Git Bash  PowerShell

]\s+/gm, '')); copying = true; setTimeout(() => copying = false, 2000);">
         
         $ docker run -it --mount type=bind,src=.,target=/src ubuntu bash
         

]\s+/gm, '')); copying = true; setTimeout(() => copying = false, 2000);">
         
         $ docker run -it --mount "type=bind,src=%cd%,target=/src" ubuntu bash
         

]\s+/gm, '')); copying = true; setTimeout(() => copying = false, 2000);">
         
         $ docker run -it --mount type=bind,src="/.",target=/src ubuntu bash
         

]\s+/gm, '')); copying = true; setTimeout(() => copying = false, 2000);">
         
         $ docker run -it --mount "type=bind,src=.,target=/src" ubuntu bash
         

The `--mount type=bind` option tells Docker to create a bind mount, where `src` is the current working directory on your host machine (`getting-started-app`), and `target` is where that directory should appear inside the container (`/src`).

  4. After running the command, Docker starts an interactive `bash` session in the root directory of the container's filesystem.

]\s+/gm, '')); copying = true; setTimeout(() => copying = false, 2000);">
         
         root@ac1237fad8db:/# pwd
         /
         root@ac1237fad8db:/# ls
         bin   dev  home  media  opt   root  sbin  srv  tmp  var
         boot  etc  lib   mnt    proc  run   src   sys  usr
         

  5. Change directory to the `src` directory.

This is the directory that you mounted when starting the container. Listing the contents of this directory displays the same files as in the `getting-started-app` directory on your host machine.

]\s+/gm, '')); copying = true; setTimeout(() => copying = false, 2000);">
         
         root@ac1237fad8db:/# cd src
         root@ac1237fad8db:/src# ls
         Dockerfile  node_modules  package.json  package-lock.json  spec  src  
         

  6. Create a new file named `myfile.txt`.

]\s+/gm, '')); copying = true; setTimeout(() => copying = false, 2000);">
         
         root@ac1237fad8db:/src# touch myfile.txt
         root@ac1237fad8db:/src# ls
         Dockerfile  myfile.txt  node_modules  package.json  package-lock.json  spec  src  
         

  7. Open the `getting-started-app` directory on the host and observe that the `myfile.txt` file is in the directory.

]\s+/gm, '')); copying = true; setTimeout(() => copying = false, 2000);">
         
         ├── getting-started-app/
         │ ├── Dockerfile
         │ ├── myfile.txt
         │ ├── node_modules/
         │ ├── package.json
         │ ├── package-lock.json
         │ ├── spec/
         │ └── src/

  8. From the host, delete the `myfile.txt` file.

  9. In the container, list the contents of the `app` directory once more. Observe that the file is now gone.

]\s+/gm, '')); copying = true; setTimeout(() => copying = false, 2000);">
         
         root@ac1237fad8db:/src# ls
         Dockerfile  node_modules  package.json  package-lock.json spec  src  
         

  10. Stop the interactive container session with `Ctrl` \+ `D`.

That's all for a brief introduction to bind mounts. This procedure demonstrated how files are shared between the host and the container, and how changes are immediately reflected on both sides. Now you can use bind mounts to develop software.

## [Development containers](#development-containers)

Using bind mounts is common for local development setups. The advantage is that the development machine doesn’t need to have all of the build tools and environments installed. With a single docker run command, Docker pulls dependencies and tools.

### [Run your app in a development container](#run-your-app-in-a-development-container)

The following steps describe how to run a development container with a bind mount that does the following:

  * Mount your source code into the container
  * Install all dependencies
  * Start `nodemon` to watch for filesystem changes

You can use the CLI or Docker Desktop to run your container with a bind mount.

Mac / Linux CLI  PowerShell CLI  Command Prompt CLI  Git Bash CLI  Docker Desktop

  1. Make sure you don't have any `getting-started` containers currently running.

  2. Run the following command from the `getting-started-app` directory.

]\s+/gm, '')); copying = true; setTimeout(() => copying = false, 2000);">
         
         $ docker run -dp 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 \
             -w /app --mount type=bind,src=.,target=/app \
             node:24-alpine \
             sh -c "npm install && npm run dev"
         

The following is a breakdown of the command:

     * `-dp 127.0.0.1:3000:3000` \- same as before. Run in detached (background) mode and create a port mapping
     * `-w /app` \- sets the "working directory" or the current directory that the command will run from
     * `--mount type=bind,src=.,target=/app` \- bind mount the current directory from the host into the `/app` directory in the container
     * `node:24-alpine` \- the image to use. Note that this is the base image for your app from the Dockerfile
     * `sh -c "npm install && npm run dev"` \- the command. You're starting a shell using `sh` (alpine doesn't have `bash`) and running `npm install` to install packages and then running `npm run dev` to start the development server. If you look in the `package.json`, you'll see that the `dev` script starts `nodemon`.
  3. You can watch the logs using `docker logs <container-id>`. You'll know you're ready to go when you see this:

]\s+/gm, '')); copying = true; setTimeout(() => copying = false, 2000);">
         
         $ docker logs -f <container-id>
         nodemon -L src/index.js
         [nodemon] 2.0.20
         [nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
         [nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
         [nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,json
         [nodemon] starting `node src/index.js`
         Using sqlite database at /etc/todos/todo.db
         Listening on port 3000
         

When you're done watching the logs, exit out by hitting `Ctrl`+`C`.

  1. Make sure you don't have any `getting-started` containers currently running.

  2. Run the following command from the `getting-started-app` directory.

]\s+/gm, '')); copying = true; setTimeout(() => copying = false, 2000);">
         
         $ docker run -dp 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 `
             -w /app --mount "type=bind,src=.,target=/app" `
             node:24-alpine `
             sh -c "npm install && npm run dev"

The following is a breakdown of the command:

     * `-dp 127.0.0.1:3000:3000` \- same as before. Run in detached (background) mode and create a port mapping
     * `-w /app` \- sets the "working directory" or the current directory that the command will run from
     * `--mount "type=bind,src=.,target=/app"` \- bind mount the current directory from the host into the `/app` directory in the container
     * `node:24-alpine` \- the image to use. Note that this is the base image for your app from the Dockerfile
     * `sh -c "npm install && npm run dev"` \- the command. You're starting a shell using `sh` (alpine doesn't have `bash`) and running `npm install` to install packages and then running `npm run dev` to start the development server. If you look in the `package.json`, you'll see that the `dev` script starts `nodemon`.
  3. You can watch the logs using `docker logs <container-id>`. You'll know you're ready to go when you see this:

]\s+/gm, '')); copying = true; setTimeout(() => copying = false, 2000);">
         
         $ docker logs -f <container-id>
         nodemon -L src/index.js
         [nodemon] 2.0.20
         [nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
         [nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
         [nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,json
         [nodemon] starting `node src/index.js`
         Using sqlite database at /etc/todos/todo.db
         Listening on port 3000
         

When you're done watching the logs, exit out by hitting `Ctrl`+`C`.

  1. Make sure you don't have any `getting-started` containers currently running.

  2. Run the following command from the `getting-started-app` directory.

         $ docker run -dp 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 ^
             -w /app --mount "type=bind,src=%cd%,target=/app" ^
             node:24-alpine ^
             sh -c "npm install && npm run dev"
         

The following is a breakdown of the command:

     * `-dp 127.0.0.1:3000:3000` \- same as before. Run in detached (background) mode and create a port mapping
     * `-w /app` \- sets the "working directory" or the current directory that the command will run from
     * `--mount "type=bind,src=%cd%,target=/app"` \- bind mount the current directory from the host into the `/app` directory in the container
     * `node:24-alpine` \- the image to use. Note that this is the base image for your app from the Dockerfile
     * `sh -c "npm install && npm run dev"` \- the command. You're starting a shell using `sh` (alpine doesn't have `bash`) and running `npm install` to install packages and then running `npm run dev` to start the development server.

             -w //app --mount type=bind,src="/.",target=/app \
             node:24-alpine \
             sh -c "npm install && npm run dev"
         

The following is a breakdown of the command:

     * `-dp 127.0.0.1:3000:3000` \- same as before. Run in detached (background) mode and create a port mapping
     * `-w //app` \- sets the "working directory" or the current directory that the command will run from
     * `--mount type=bind,src="/.",target=/app` \- bind mount the current directory from the host into the `/app` directory in the container
     * `node:24-alpine` \- the image to use. Note that this is the base image for your app from the Dockerfile

         Listening on port 3000
         

When you're done watching the logs, exit out by hitting `Ctrl`+`C`.

Make sure you don't have any `getting-started` containers currently running.

Run the image with a bind mount.

  1. Select the search box at the top of Docker Desktop.

  2. In the search window, select the **Images** tab.

  3. In the search box, specify the container name, `getting-started`.

> Tip
> 
> Use the search filter to filter images and only show **Local images**.

  4. Select your image and then select **Run**.

  5. Select **Optional settings**.

  6. In **Host path** , specify the path to the `getting-started-app` directory on your host machine.

  7. In **Container path** , specify `/app`.

  8. Select **Run**.

You can watch the container logs using Docker Desktop.

  1. Select **Containers** in Docker Desktop.
  2. Select your container name.

You'll know you're ready to go when you see this:

]\s+/gm, '')); copying = true; setTimeout(() => copying = false, 2000);">
    
    
    nodemon -L src/index.js
    [nodemon] 2.0.20

    [nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,json
    [nodemon] starting `node src/index.js`
    Using sqlite database at /etc/todos/todo.db
    Listening on port 3000
    

### [Develop your app with the development container](#develop-your-app-with-the-development-container)

Update your app on your host machine and see the changes reflected in the container.

  1. In the `src/static/js/app.js` file, on line 109, change the "Add Item" button to simply say "Add":

]\s+/gm, '')); copying = true; setTimeout(() => copying = false, 2000);">
         
         - {submitting ? 'Adding...' : 'Add Item'}
         + {submitting ? 'Adding...' : 'Add'}
         

Save the file.

  2. Refresh the page in your web browser, and you should see the change reflected almost immediately because of the bind mount. Nodemon detects the change and restarts the server. It might take a few seconds for the Node server to restart. If you get an error, try refreshing after a few seconds.

![Screenshot of updated label for Add button](images/img_000_b05de2a8.webp)

  3. Feel free to make any other changes you'd like to make. Each time you make a change and save a file, the change is reflected in the container because of the bind mount. When Nodemon detects a change, it restarts the app inside the container automatically. When you're done, stop the container and build your new image using:

]\s+/gm, '')); copying = true; setTimeout(() => copying = false, 2000);">
         
         $ docker build -t getting-started .
         

## [Summary](#summary)

At this point, you can persist your database and see changes in your app as you develop without rebuilding the image.

In addition to volume mounts and bind mounts, Docker also supports other mount types and storage drivers for handling more complex and specialized use cases.

## [Next steps](#next-steps)

In order to prepare your app for production, you need to migrate your database from working in SQLite to something that can scale a little better. For simplicity, you'll keep using a relational database and switch your application to use MySQL. But, how should you run MySQL? How do you allow the containers to talk to each other? You'll learn about that in the next section.
