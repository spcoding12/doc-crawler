Docker and the broader community of Docker experts have put together many different ways to get further training and hands-on experience with Docker. Expand your understanding of Docker and Kubernetes with these additional free and paid resources.

## [Docker Training](#docker-training)

Expand your knowledge on all things Docker with [basic to advanced trainings from Docker experts](https://www.docker.com/trainings/).

You can find recorded content at your own convenience, or register for a live session to participate in Q&A.

## [Hosted labs](#hosted-labs)

These self-paced and hands-on workshops use a free, hosted environment ([Play with Kubernetes](https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/)) that doesn't require any installation. Follow along and learn more about Kubernetes.

  * [Kubernetes Workshop](https://training.play-with-kubernetes.com/kubernetes-workshop/)

* Labs are free but require registration with a Docker ID.

## [Self-guided tutorials](#self-guided-tutorials)

Created by experts in the Docker community, these free tutorials provide guided step-by-step workflows for working with the Docker platform.

  * **Integrating Docker with Your IDE**

    * [Java Development: Eclipse](https://training.play-with-docker.com/java-debugging-eclipse/)
    * [Java Development: IntelliJ](https://training.play-with-docker.com/java-debugging-intellij/)
    * [Java Development: Netbeans](https://training.play-with-docker.com/java-debugging-netbeans/)
    * [Live Debugging Node.js with Docker and Visual Studio Code](https://training.play-with-docker.com/nodejs-live-debugging/)
  * **Windows Containers**

    * [Windows Container Setup](https://training.play-with-docker.com/windows-containers-setup/)
    * [Windows Container Basics](https://training.play-with-docker.com/windows-containers-basics/)
    * [Windows Containers Multi-Container Applications](https://training.play-with-docker.com/windows-containers-multicontainer/)

## [Books](#books)

If books are your preferred learning style, check out these written by the [Docker Captains](https://www.docker.com/community/captains). Docker Captain is a distinction that Docker awards to select members of the community that are both experts in their field and are committed to sharing their Docker knowledge with others.
