Congratulations on completing the Docker workshop. You've learned how to containerize applications, work with multi-container setups, use Docker Compose, and apply image-building best practices.

Here's what to explore next.

## [Secure your images](#secure-your-images)

Take your image-building skills to the next level with Docker Hardened Images—secure, minimal, and production-ready base images that are now free for everyone.

### [What are Docker Hardened Images?Understand secure, minimal, production-ready base images with near-zero CVEs.](/dhi/explore/what/)

### [Get started with DHIPull and run your first Docker Hardened Image in minutes.](/dhi/get-started/)

### [Use hardened imagesLearn how to use DHI in your Dockerfiles and CI/CD pipelines.](/dhi/how-to/use/)

### [Explore the DHI catalogBrowse available hardened images, variants, and security attestations.](/dhi/how-to/explore/)

## [Build with AI](#build-with-ai)

Docker makes it easy to run AI models locally and build agentic AI applications. Explore Docker's AI tools and start building AI-powered apps.

### [Docker Model RunnerRun and manage AI models locally using familiar Docker commands with OpenAI-compatible APIs.](/ai/model-runner/)

### [MCP ToolkitSet up, manage, and run containerized MCP servers to power your AI agents.](/ai/mcp-catalog-and-toolkit/toolkit/)

### [Build AI agents with cagentCreate teams of specialized AI agents that collaborate to solve complex problems.](/ai/cagent/)

### [Use AI models in ComposeDefine AI model dependencies in your Docker Compose applications.](/compose/how-tos/model-runner/)

## [Language-specific guides](#language-specific-guides)

Apply what you've learned to your preferred programming language with hands-on tutorials.

### [Node.jsLearn how to containerize and develop Node.js applications.](/guides/language/nodejs/)

### [PythonBuild and run Python applications in containers.](/guides/language/python/)

### [JavaContainerize Java applications with best practices.](/guides/language/java/)

### [GoDevelop and deploy Go applications using Docker.](/guides/language/golang/)
