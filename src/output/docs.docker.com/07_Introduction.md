**Skill level** Beginner

**Time to complete** 15 minutes

**Prerequisites** None

## [About this series](#about-this-series)

In this guide series, you will gain hands-on experience with Docker, starting with installing and setting up Docker Desktop on your local machine. You will learn how to run your first container, understanding the basics of containerization and its benefits. This series guides you through building your first Docker image, providing insights into creating efficient and reusable images. Finally, you will explore how to publish your image on Docker Hub, enabling you to share your work with the broader community and leverage Docker's powerful ecosystem for collaborative development and deployment.

## [What you'll learn](#what-youll-learn)

  * Set up Docker Desktop
  * Run your first container
  * Build your first image
  * Publish your image on Docker Hub

## [Modules](#modules)

1\. Get Docker Desktop

Getting Docker Desktop up and running is the first crucial step for developers diving into containerization, offering a seamless and user-friendly interface for managing Docker containers. Docker Desktop simplifies the process of building, sharing, and running applications in containers, ensuring consistency across different environments.

[Start](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/introduction/get-docker-desktop/)

2\. Develop with containers

Learn how to run your first container, gaining hands-on experience with Docker's powerful features. We'll cover making real-time changes to both backend and frontend code within the containerized environment, ensuring seamless integration and testing.

[Start](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/introduction/develop-with-containers/)

3\. Build and push your first image

Learn how to build your first Docker image, a key step in containerizing your application. We'll guide you through the process of creating an image repository and building and pushing your image to Docker Hub. This enables you to share your image easily within your team.

[Start](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/introduction/build-and-push-first-image/)

4\. What's next

Now that you have set up Docker Desktop, developed with containers, and built and pushed your first image, you are ready to take the next step and dive deep into what a container is and how it works.
