# Introduction

Your introduction to understanding how to use quality profiles in SonarQube Server.

Quality profiles are a key part of your SonarQube configuration. A quality profile defines, for a given language, the set of coding rules to be applied during analysis.

Built-in quality profiles are provided. As a quality profile administrator, you can create your own custom quality profiles to meet your coding analysis needs.

This section explains the quality profile concept in the Sonar solution, how to retrieve and view quality profiles and, for quality profile administrators, how to manage their custom quality profiles.
